# How do arrest rates differ for different demographics?

This is an interactive app created with R Shiny and Plotly using data from the [California Department of Justice via OpenJustice](https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/). [You can view and interact with the functioning app here, so long as the Swarthmore R Shiny server is up.](http://52.22.110.202:3838/jrosen2/app2/)

This app was created by myself and my classmate Jake Rosen in the fall of 2015 in Professor Kelly McConville's Data Visualization and Analysis course at Swarthmore College. I did the majority of the coding, because it was fun. At the time, I had only taken one basic computer science course, so this code is messier than I would likely write now (especially as I have had more experience with R Shiny).
